# PLD-Wrapper
A high-level wrapper, intended to make the package PLD.jl, more accessible and faster.

Note: PLD-Wrapper will soon be made available as a single executable file, once it's functionality has been fully implemented.
The source code will remain public for those who want more control, or are just curious about the inner workings.

Once the full version is released, installation instructions will be shipped to this readme.
